# Module 18 - Tableau
This repo just contains the data used for the tableau project.
I downloaded the data from citibike then used python to combine them and access the single file, instead of trying to do it in tableau. I also used python to create a ranked list of the bike stations, with the total rides per station. This ranking is used in the map.

## Data

I used the availble March-June data for 2023. This goes from 3/1/23 to 6/23/23.

## Findings

In the Tableau story, we can clearly see a few trends:

- ridership increases over the course of the spring
- daily ridership is centered on the morning and evening hours
- there is a spike on Fridays and on weekends
- there are differences in bike selection between casual and membership riders
